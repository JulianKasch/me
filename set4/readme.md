TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Dataset ideas: https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-sdinsw-%7BA3D1D499-6164-493D-95E7-4096056F5C3B%7D/details?q=NSW%20traffic%20control
I really wanted a data set that has speedbump locations on it, and this one should cover that, it's just that it's last updated 2015, maybe I can find something that contains what I want more recently updated...
ok went to the 'spatial' collaboration portal and they have a more up to date thingy

I'm starting to have doubts
for first part of exercise1  have to remember I can use the debug thing going line by line so I don't have to eyeball the index of the thing I want from the json file that was read.
pokemon was fine, just had to not use ">=" instead of ">" because apparently the first pokedex test wanted it first come first served for the "tallest" pokemon from lowest to highest and wouldn't tolerate another equally tall pokemon which the instructions didn't communicate to me but whatever I'm not mad I'm just a little annoyed.
Wait So I ran the test and it just didn't make the lasers.pew but then I ran the exercise itself and it did? And then the test passed. Oh well it counts my code made the correct file fair and square.
