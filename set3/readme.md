TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Loop ranger and two step range were pretty self explanatory
Just had to learn how to do a while loop to do stubborn asker.
not number rejector required me to use 'continue' to go back to the start of the innermost loop (a while loop in this case) that it's currently at so I could skip the Any_number = true line (since it wasn't supposed to be true yet until the except did not trigger).
super asker just needed me to be REALLY sure that my continue word put it where I thought it would and make sure to remove a redundant line that the two functions I was combining had. And that's exercise 1 done for set 3.
