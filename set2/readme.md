3:55 defining the adding functions seems easy enough
4:03 ok the linked documentation says a lot of stuff that I don't quite get right now, but after clicking "string methods" there were some function thingies and I found one to capitalise all the letters there.
4:18 ok I think I can just use a + to stick an exclamation mark onto the shout()-ed phrase.
4:23 The page also said that I could make whatever a_number from an integer or a float into a string. Then I can concatenate from there.
4:29 since that didn't work I'll try and cocatenate a space in the middle.This ends exercise 0
5:05 did exercise one, took me a bit to getting used to the debug tool, using breakpoints to stop the code where I want it before spamming step into to go through the code line by line
5:17 debugged the file exercise2, was probably more self explanatory than the real bugs I'll run into...
