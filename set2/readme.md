3:55 defining the adding functions seems easy enough
4:03 ok the linked documentation says a lot of stuff that I don't quite get right now, but after clicking "string methods" there were some function thingies and I found one to capitalise all the letters there.
4:18 ok I think I can just use a + to stick an exclamation mark onto the shout()-ed phrase.
4:23 The page also said that I could make whatever a_number from an integer or a float into a string. Then I can concatenate from there.
4:29 since that didn't work I'll try and cocatenate a space in the middle.This ends exercise 0
5:05 did exercise one, took me a bit to getting used to the debug tool, using breakpoints to stop the code where I want it before spamming step into to go through the code line by line
5:17 debugged the file exercise2, was probably more self explanatory than the real bugs I'll run into...
5:30 finished is_odd
5:49 Finished flow chart thing, yeah I coulda shortened it further, I don't know why using less than 4 "returns" is supposed to be a challenge, isn't there only supposed to be a single response why would I ever need 4?
Loop 3 sure threw me for a loop for a bit, but I just had to use the * symbol to multiply an existing list and thus keep the list having identical values throughout.
loop 4 is easy.
For loops 5 and 6 I just had to understand how to nest another for loop. Note I just concatenated the strings for exercise 5 with + but the .format thing exists.
loop 7 was a pain because I had a way to figure out how many ' 's and '*'s I would need each row(list) with just one for loop variable thing but it turns out I could use   .extend instead of stupid .append so that instead of my rows being made of mutiple lists which was not intended, I could add the three contributing lists for each row together and they would form one list per row.
